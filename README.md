# Verona Player Testbed

This web application enables easy testing of verona player modules. After loading the player and suitable units, one can interact and navigate like a test-taker. 

The testing is "easy", because we bundled the whole application into one html-file. You can download and use it offline without any server. If you stay online, you can use the testbed directly via this link: [Verona-Player-Testbed](https://iqb-berlin.github.io/verona-player-testbed).
